              We use a large block of connected links for our pagination, making links hard to miss
              and easily scalable—all while providing large hit areas. Pagination is built with list
              HTML elements so screen readers can announce the number of available links. Use a
              wrapping <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element to identify it as a navigation section to
              screen readers and other assistive technologies.

                    <strong>This is the first item&#39;s accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by
                    default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to
                    style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the
                    showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom
                    CSS or overriding our default variables. It&#39;s also worth noting that just
                    about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the
                    transition does limit overflow.
